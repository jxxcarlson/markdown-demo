# Markdown + Math

This is the simplest use case of the package
[jxxcarlson//elm-markdown](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jxxcarlson/elm-markdown/latest/),
the purpose of which is to render Markdown with math. No fancy editor,
no diffing to improve performance,
no debouncing for rapid typists,
so the document
is re-rendered on each stroke of the keyboard. No other fancy stuff like an active table of contents,
which is also possible. See
the [docs](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jxxcarlson/elm-markdown/latest/)
for more info on implementing these options in your app. Or go to
[markdown.minilatex.app](https://markdown.minilatex.app/) for a fancier
version of the app which makes more expensive use of
this pacakge.

Pythagoras said that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
