# Example2

One can use colors, as in the examples
below.

> This is a @class[blue test], but
if something should go wrong, you 
will receive a @class[red warning]. The 
color @class[green green] is also available.

The syntax is as in this example:

````
    @class[red warning]
````

One can easily define other inline elements with the 
`@` syntax. 


As you can see, I have some issues with 
spacing and punctuation to deal with.

To make these colors, or any other class
element operational, make a CSS definition 
of the class in `./public/assets/style.css`.
